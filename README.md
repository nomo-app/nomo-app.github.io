# Nomo App Developer Hub

In the beginning, the [Nomo App](https://nomo.app) was only a crypto wallet, but now the Nomo App has evolved into a "super app".
Therefore, this site provides an overview for Nomo developers.

The Nomo App includes the following frameworks for developers:

- WebOns: Run WebOns within the Nomo App, including Decentralized Apps ("_DApps_").
- Nomo-ID: A protocol for authenticating via the Nomo App.

## WebOns

A WebOn is a **web application** that works within the Nomo App.
WebOns are a powerful capability of the Nomo App that unlock the following features in an easy-to-use way:

- Crypto wallet functionality.
- Decentralized messaging.
- Optional: Verification that users are real via a KYC mechanism.
- AI-powered features.
- Authentication with Nomo-ID or Nomo-Auth.
- And much more to come...

### Find out more about WebOns

Visit the **Nomo WebOn Kit** at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nomo-app/nomo-webon-kit) to see what WebOns can do.
The repository contains a demo WebOn where you can see how to create a WebOn for the Nomo app.

Moreover, the following npm packages are provided for WebOn developers:

- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/nomo-webon-kit>
- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethersjs-nomo-webons>
- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3js-nomo-webons>
- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/nomo-auth>

## Nomo-ID

Nomo-ID is a flexible protocol for web3-based authentication, without any passwords.
There exist multiple websites that allow login via Nomo-ID, but Nomo-ID can do much more than logins.

You can find out more about Nomo-ID at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nomo-app/nomo-id).

### Nomo-ID Sample Application

The repository contains a specification of the protocol as well as a sample application.
The backend of the sample application is written in Node.js/Express, and the frontend is written in React/Next.js.

Although the sample application contains a frontend, the Nomo-ID protocol could be used even without any frontend.
In a minimal use case, Nomo-ID could be used just by printing a QR code on a piece of paper.
